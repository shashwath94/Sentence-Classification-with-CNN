0	the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .
0	a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps .
0	it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
0	a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .

1	sex with strangers is fascinating . . .

1	funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness .
1	i love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off .

1	it strikes hardest when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill .
